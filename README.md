My name is James Drayton Beninger, but my friends call me Drayton. I was born in Canada, but I mostly grew up in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Barbados. I love to work on 
fine-grained practical programming projects, but I'm always interested in learning more about techniques and address larger questions. 

I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor's in Cognitive Systems. This allowed me to learn computer science while supplementing my 
learning with courses from psychology and philosophy. My favorite areas of study are AI and functional programming, but I've taken classes and finished projects in other
fields as well. You can see a list of projects I've worked on below. Everything highlighted in blue has demos that you can click on and try, while 
everything else is either too abstract to put in a demo or is a work in progress. Feel free to take a look!
